## Overview

This project involves solving a regression problem by leveraging multiple machine learning algorithms and techniques. The primary objectives were:
- To explore and optimize diverse regression models.
- To compare model performances and identify the best-performing approach.
- To generate insights into feature importance and model interpretability.
- To expand my professional portfolio with an example of real-world problem-solving in data science.

The models trained include **XGBoost**, **GradientBoosting**, **LightGBM**, and **TabNet**, which were optimized and validated using cross-validation with the RMSE metric.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `xgboost`
  - `lightgbm`
  - `pytorch-tabnet`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and scaling the dataset.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Implementing regression models.
   - Hyperparameter optimization using techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search.
   - Cross-validation for robust performance validation.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating models based on RMSE.
   - Comparing results across different algorithms.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Analyzing feature importance for interpretability.
   - Generating visualizations to identify key drivers of predictions.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Creating bar charts to compare model performance.
   - Adding labels to visualize RMSE values for each model.

## Models Implemented

The following models were trained and evaluated:
- **XGBoost Regressor**
- **GradientBoosting Regressor**
- **LightGBM Regressor**
- **TabNet Regressor**

## Results and Evaluation

- The models were evaluated based on their Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on both training and test datasets.
- Predictions from all four models were aggregated and visualized for comparative analysis.
- The best-performing model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and low error variance.

## Feature Importance Analysis

- Feature importance was analyzed for the **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** models using their built-in functionality.
- Visualizations were created to highlight the most influential features driving the predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate real-world datasets for further validation.
- Experiment with additional ensemble techniques or hybrid models.
- Deploy the best-performing model as an interactive web application or API.
- Extend the analysis to include time-series regression tasks.

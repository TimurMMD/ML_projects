*This dataset provides blockchain financial transactions within the Open Metaverse, designed for the development and testing of advanced analytics in fraud detection, risk assessment, and user behavior analysis. It encompasses 78,600 transactions across a diverse set of parameters, including transaction types, amounts, user activity profiles, and risk scores. Each record features detailed attributes such as timestamps, sending and receiving addresses, transaction categories, geographical regions, IP prefixes, and calculated risk levels, providing a comprehensive foundation for research and development in blockchain technologies and security within virtual environments.*

The problem is defined in the classification framework, where the predicted variable is “anomaly”. An anomaly is a parameter that shows the risk level of the transaction in a 3 type way: "high_risk", "moderate_risk" and "low_risk"

The structure of the Project:

1. Exploratory Analysis
2. Visualization Analysis
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Machine Learning
5. Conclusion

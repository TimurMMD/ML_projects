## The objective of this project is to create a model that would be able to predict the promotion of the individual based on his personal information.
## Therefore, this project is a classical Binary Classification project.
So far, the accuracy of the prediction after the submission on the Vidhya website is around 47% (with the best results around 53-54%). Reasonably a good result for the first attempt, espaecially if to consider that we have a room for an imporvement.
### Project Structure:
- 1. Library Instantiation
- 2. Data Upload
- 3. Data Exploring and Cleaning
- 4. Data Visualisation
- 5. Data Preprocessing
- 6. Data Training
- 7. Data Testing and Evaluation
In this case were used Boosting Algorithms mainly as they have shown better result.
